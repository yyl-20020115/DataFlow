## 🔍 1. What  is DataFlow？

<!--  <img src="./static/images/dataflow_framework.jpg"> -->

<!--  ![dataflow_framework](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b44db630-754a-44a8-bec7-6d350bf5ed61) -->



DataFlow is a data preparation and training system designed to **generate, refine, evaluate, and filter** high-quality data for AI from noisy sources (PDF, plain-text, low-quality QA), thereby improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in specific domains through targeted training (Pre-training, Supervised Fine-tuning, RL training) or RAG system, in domains such as healthcare, finance, legal, and academic research.

Through an `operator-based` design, DataFlow turns the entire data cleaning workflow into a reproducible, reusable, and shareable `pipeline`, providing core infrastructure for the Data-Centric AI community. Additionally, we develop an intelligent `DataFlow-agent` capable of dynamically assembling new `pipelines` by recombining existing or creating new `operators` on demand.

<!-- Specifically, we are constructing diverse `operators` leveraging rule-based methods, deep learning models, LLMs, and LLM APIs. These operators are systematically integrated into distinct `pipelines`, collectively forming the comprehensive `DataFlow system`. Additionally, we develop an intelligent `DataFlow-agent` capable of dynamically assembling new `pipelines` by recombining existing `operators` on demand. -->

## 🛠️ 3. DataFlow Suite 
The DataFlow Suite provides the essential infrastructure to automate and scale LLM data preparation with DataFlow main repository. It comprises four tightly integrated layers:
- [DataFlow-Skills](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Skills) – A collection of skills and tutorials for working with DataFlow, covering operator development, pipeline construction, and best practices for data-centric AI.

- [DataFlow-WebUI](#dfwebui) – An intuitive, visual interface for constructing and managing complex data pipelines through a drag-and-drop operator workflow.

- [DataFlow-Agent](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-Agent) – An AI-powered assistant that dynamically composes, executes, and optimizes operators and pipelines based on high-level user intent.

- [DataFlow-Ecosystem](#awesome-dataflow) – A modular distribution layer that standardizes operator registration. It enables domain-specific modules (e.g., [DataFlow-MM](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/DataFlow-MM), DataFlow-AI4S) to contribute extensible libraries under a unified abstraction.

- [RayOrch](https://github.com/OpenDCAI/RayOrch) – A high-performance orchestration layer built on Ray, providing distributed compute scheduling and resource management for massive-scale data tasks.

Together, these components form a unified, extensible environment that transforms raw data into model-ready intelligence.

## ✅ 4. Why use DataFlow?
Data generation and cleaning are crucial for high-quality models, but for both enterprises and individuals, these tasks are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. **DataFlow provides a one-stop solution to tackle these challenges efficiently.**
Compared with systems like Nemo-Curator and Data-Juicer, DataFlow offers:
- **Enhanced Support for Data Synthesis Modules** – Seamlessly integrates text, code, and math data generation pipeline for high-quality training datasets.
- **PyTorch-like Programming Management** – Clear **Pipeline → Operator → Prompt** hierarchical structure for workflow control.
- **Principled and Multi-Category Operator Classification** – Operators are systematically organized into multiple functional categories such as **generation, evaluation, filtering, and refinement**, forming a scientifically grounded, multi-dimensional taxonomy that reflects different stages of data preparation and enables precise operator selection and composition.
- **User-Friendly Design for Easy Debugging and Onboarding** – Simplified workflow patterns that reduce the learning curve and accelerate experimentation.


## 🔧 5. How do operators work？
DataFlow operators are designed with **simplicity and clarity** in mind.

Operators take structured inputs (JSON, JSONL, CSV) and produce high-quality outputs after intelligent processing.
Each operator encapsulates a specific data processing task, providing a clean and consistent API that is easy to understand and integrate. The PyTorch-like design makes them intuitive and ready to use, allowing you to quickly build, combine, and customize pipelines without dealing with complex boilerplate code.

 For more details, refer to the [Operator Documentation](https://opendcai.github.io/DataFlow-Doc/zh/api/home/). Below is a minimal example demonstrating how to invoke the `PromptedGenerator` operator: 

![dataflow_operator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d79a0d8b-09ef-457e-af8b-85af0d03b73d)

Example input data (json/jsonl-style):

```json
// input.json
[
  {"problem": "What is 17 + 25?"},
  {"problem": "If x = 3, compute 2x^2 + 1."}
]
```

Operator invocation code:

```python
from dataflow.operators.core_text import PromptedGenerator
from dataflow.utils.storage import FileStorage
from dataflow.serving import APILLMServing_request

# set input file to global storage class
storage = FileStorage(first_entry_file_name="./input.json",)

# configure LLM serving (e.g., OpenAI API)
# api key needs to be set via `export DF_API_KEY=sk-xxx`
llm_serving = APILLMServing_request(
    api_url="https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
)

prompted_generator = PromptedGenerator(
    llm_serving=llm_serving,  # pre-configured LLM backend
    system_prompt="Please solve this math problem."
)

prompted_generator.run(
    storage=self.storage.step(),  # data management (details omitted)
    input_key="problem",          # read from this column
    output_key="solution"         # write to this column
)
```
After running, the operator will append the generated results into output_key. For example, the output data (json/jsonl-style) becomes:

```json
// dataflow_step1.json
[
    {"problem":"What is 17 + 25?","solution":"42"},
    {"problem":"If x = 3, compute 2x^2 + 1.","solution":"19"}
]
```

## 🧪 8. Experimental Results

### 8.1 DataFlow-Instruct-10k
**DataFlow-Instruct-10K** is a unified multi-domain instruction dataset generated by the DataFlow framework. It is constructed through several automated data preparation pipelines spanning mathematical reasoning, code, and general text instructions. Each pipeline follows a generate–evaluate–filter–refine workflow to synthesize and curate high-quality instruction–response pairs. The resulting dataset contains approximately 10K samples and provides high-quality supervision for instruction tuning, enabling base models to approach the performance of fully trained instruct models with significantly fewer training examples.

##### 8.2.1.2 SFT data filter and synthesis pipeline

To study small-scale SFT data quality, we fine-tune the Qwen2.5-7B base model using LLaMA-Factory on WizardLM and Alpaca datasets. For each dataset, we compared a randomly sampled set of 5K instances against a set of 5K instances filtered by DataFlow's SFT pipeline. Additionally, we synthesize a 15k-size dataset, DataFlow-SFT-15K, using DataFlow’s Condor Generator and Condor Refiner pipeline, followed by DataFlow’s SFT filtering pipeline (excluding the Instagram filter). Benchmarks include comprehensive Math, Code, and Knowledge evaluation suites.

#### 8.2.5 Conversation Synthesis Pipeline

We synthesize DataFlow-Chat-15K using DataFlow's conversation-generation pipeline and fine-tune Qwen2.5-7B-Base on it. Baselines include ShareGPT-15K, UltraChat-15K, and their full (non-truncated) versions. We evaluate on domain-specific tasks (TopDial, Light) and general benchmarks (MMLU, AlpacaEval, Arena-Hard).

##### 8.2.5.1 Conversation Benchmarks

#### 8.2.6 Reasoning Pipeline

We adopt the NuminaMath dataset as a high-quality seed dataset. We compare three training sources: (1) a random 10K subset from Open-R1, (2) a random 10K subset from Synthetic-1, and (3) our 10K synthesized DataFlow-Reasoning-10K dataset constructed using DataFlow.

| Setting | Model | gsm8k | math | amc23 | olympiad | gaokao24_mix | minerva | AIME24@32 | AIME25@32 | Avg |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### 8.2.7 Code Pipeline

We randomly sample 20k instances from the Ling-Coder-SFT corpus and process them through the DataFlow Code Pipeline. This yields three curated code instruction datasets of different scales, DataFlow-Code-1K, DataFlow-Code-5K, and DataFlow-Code-10K, each designed to provide high-quality, pipeline-refined supervision signals for code generation tasks. We compare our synthesized datasets against Code-Alpaca-1k and Self-OSS-Instruct-SC2-Exec-Filter-1k.
